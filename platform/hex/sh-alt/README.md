These are three alternate implementations of the Onramp hex tool in POSIX shell that do not use arithmetic expressions nor parameter expansion. They should work on even a very limited POSIX-style shell.

Unfortunately they are extremely slow. I'm leaving them here for now in case they are useful, and to at some point test whether it's possible to make them faster.
