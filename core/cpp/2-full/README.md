# Onramp Preprocessor -- Final Stage

This is the final stage Onramp C preprocessor. It implements all C preprocessor features and various popular extensions.

It is written in Onramp Practical C (opC), except that it only relies on the Onramp Minimal C (omC) preprocessor. (There is no intermediate opC preprocessor.)

This stage is already 95% implemented... in Python. It needs to be converted to C. This will be much less work than it took to write it in Python in the first place so this stage is already mostly done. The code for that is not here so this currently looks empty (there are a ton of unit tests though!)
